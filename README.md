# NYC_Citibike

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create visualizations using New York City Citibike data in order to better understand and illustrate key data points. 

## Results 
Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

For this analysis we have 7 different visualizations:

### Trip Duration:

</p>

We can see from our plot of trip duration that the most frequent duration is 5 minutes. We can also observe that almost all of the trips are less than an hour. 

### Trip Duration by Gender:

</p>

When we break down trip duration by gender, we see much of the same. Male, Female, and Unknown genders all peak around the 5 minute duration mark. We can also see that there are far more males using Citibikes, denoted by the orange line.

It is clear from both of our trip duration graphs that the bulk of use for Citibikes in NYC is only for a short trip of usually around 5 minutes.
